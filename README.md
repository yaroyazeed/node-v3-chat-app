# node-v3-chat-app
This app demonstrates real time messaging using socket.io
It allows users log into a chat room (through a log in form) and leave a chatroom (by closing the tab). It notifies users when a new user joins and when a user leaves a chat room.
It also allows users send their location through a url as a clickable link which will redirect them to google maps and display their location.

## To start the app
1. run: `npm run dev` in the visual studio code console to start the app 
2. type in `localhost:3000` into your web browser to access the app
